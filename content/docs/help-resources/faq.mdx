# FAQ

## General Questions

### What is Arch Network?

Arch Network is a Bitcoin-native computation environment that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications while maintaining direct integration with Bitcoin's security model. Unlike Layer 2 solutions, Arch Network provides a native computation layer that works directly with Bitcoin UTXOs.

### How is Arch Network different from other blockchain platforms?

Arch Network is unique because it:
- **Bitcoin-Native**: Direct integration with Bitcoin's UTXO model
- **No Token Required**: Uses Bitcoin for transaction fees and security
- **Threshold Signatures**: Uses ROAST/FROST consensus for security
- **Programmable**: Supports smart contracts written in Rust
- **Scalable**: Efficient state management and parallel processing

### What programming languages are supported?

Currently, Arch Network supports:
- **Rust**: Primary language for smart contract development
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: For client applications and SDK usage
- **Future**: Additional languages may be added based on community demand

## Development Questions

### How do I get started with Arch Network development?

1. **Install Prerequisites**: Rust, Solana CLI, Arch CLI, and Docker
2. **Set up Local Environment**: Use `arch-cli orchestrate start` for automated setup
3. **Write Your First Program**: Follow our [Writing Your First Program guide](/docs/development/writing-your-first-program)
4. **Deploy and Test**: Use the local validator for testing

### What tools do I need for development?

Essential tools:
- **Rust**: For smart contract development
- **Solana CLI**: For program compilation
- **Arch CLI**: For deployment and testing
- **Docker**: For running the complete stack locally
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE with Rust extensions

### How do I test my programs?

You can test your programs using:
- **Local Validator**: Run `arch-cli orchestrate start` for a complete local environment
- **Unit Tests**: Write Rust tests for your program logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test with the full validator stack
- **Client Applications**: Build TypeScript/JavaScript clients

## Technical Questions

### How does Arch Network integrate with Bitcoin?

Arch Network integrates with Bitcoin through:
- **UTXO Management**: Direct interaction with Bitcoin UTXOs
- **State Anchoring**: Program state is anchored to Bitcoin transactions
- **Threshold Signatures**: Uses Bitcoin-compatible Schnorr signatures
- **RPC Integration**: Communicates with Bitcoin nodes via RPC

### What is the consensus mechanism?

Arch Network uses a combination of:
- **ROAST**: Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold Signatures
- **FROST**: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures
- **DKG**: Distributed Key Generation for validator coordination
- **Bitcoin Finality**: Leverages Bitcoin's security guarantees

### How do I handle Bitcoin transactions in my programs?

You can interact with Bitcoin transactions through:
- **UTXO Operations**: Create, spend, and manage UTXOs
- **Transaction Validation**: Verify Bitcoin transaction signatures
- **State Transitions**: Update program state based on Bitcoin events
- **RPC Calls**: Query Bitcoin network state

## Deployment Questions

### How do I deploy my program to the network?

1. **Build Your Program**: Use `cargo build-sbf` to compile
2. **Deploy Locally**: Use `arch-cli deploy` for local testing
3. **Testnet Deployment**: Deploy to testnet for broader testing
4. **Mainnet Deployment**: Deploy to mainnet (when available)

### What networks are available?

Currently available:
- **Regtest**: Local development network
- **Testnet**: Public test network with real Bitcoin testnet
- **Mainnet**: Production network (coming soon)

### How do I interact with deployed programs?

You can interact with programs using:
- **Arch CLI**: Command-line interface for basic operations
- **TypeScript SDK**: For building web applications
- **Rust SDK**: For building Rust applications
- **RPC API**: Direct API calls for custom integrations

## Troubleshooting Questions

### My program won't compile. What should I check?

Common compilation issues:
- **Rust Version**: Ensure you're using the latest stable Rust
- **Dependencies**: Check that all dependencies are properly specified
- **Arch Program Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible version
- **Build Tools**: Verify Solana CLI is properly installed

### The validator won't start. What's wrong?

Common startup issues:
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is running and accessible
- **Ports**: Check that required ports (9002, 18443, 8080) are available
- **Dependencies**: Verify Bitcoin Core and Titan are properly configured
- **Permissions**: Check file permissions for data directories

### My program deployed but isn't working. How do I debug?

Debugging steps:
1. **Check Logs**: Use `arch-cli orchestrate logs` to view validator logs
2. **Verify Deployment**: Confirm the program was deployed correctly
3. **Test Locally**: Use unit tests to verify program logic
4. **Check Accounts**: Ensure all required accounts are created
5. **Validate Inputs**: Verify instruction data is correct
