## What is Arch Network?

Arch Network is a computation environment that enhances Bitcoin's capabilities by enabling complex operations on Bitcoin UTXOs through its specialized virtual machine. Unlike Layer 2 solutions, Arch Network provides a native computation layer that works directly with Bitcoin's security model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js v19+ ([installation guide](/docs/Quick-Start/requirements))
- Rust (latest stable)
- Docker for local development
- Basic understanding of [Bitcoin Integration](/docs/core-concepts/bitcoin-integration)

## Core Architecture

### How Arch Works

Arch Network consists of three main components:

1. **Network Layer**
   - [Network Architecture](/docs/Setup-Infrastructure/network-architecture)
     - [Bootnode](/docs/Setup-Infrastructure/network-architecture): Network discovery and peer management
     - [Leader Node](/docs/Setup-Infrastructure/network-architecture): Transaction coordination
     - [Validator Nodes](/docs/Setup-Infrastructure/network-architecture): Program execution

2. **Bitcoin Integration**
   - [UTXO Management](/docs/Core-Concepts/bitcoin-integration)
     - Transaction tracking
     - State anchoring
     - Ownership validation
   - [RPC Integration](/docs/Core-Concepts/bitcoin-integration)
     - Bitcoin node communication
     - Transaction submission
     - Network synchronization

3. **Computation Layer**
   - [Programs](/docs/development/writing-your-first-program)
     - [Instructions](/docs/development/writing-your-first-program)
     - [Accounts](/docs/development/writing-your-first-program)
     - [System Calls](/docs/development/writing-your-first-program)
   - [Transaction Processing](/docs/Tools-&-APIs/sdk)
     - Message validation
     - State updates
     - UTXO management
